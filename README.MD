# do-not-use-hakenkreuz

I recently found out that it is `Protestware`. I thought it was a good activity until I knew the substance of this.

However, repositories such as `peacenotwar` include symbols that symbolize genocides such as Hakenkreuz.

I became suspicious of the real intentions of these people.
